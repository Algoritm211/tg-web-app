This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Run project on your machine

1. Install dependencies running command `npm install`

2. Rename file `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and add appropriate variables

3. **Don't forget to remove webhook while development and set it after deploying application**

For more convenient work with the webhook, rename the file `http-client.private.example.env.json` to `http-client.private.env.json` and add appropriate variables

Then, use file webhookOperations.http to run requests from your IDE
